excerpt: November 2016, I started seriously preparing myself for track season. Little I knew, the path will lead me further to Marathon in October 2017. I want to share a story in which I explain briefly the whole process and why I even decided to run marathon in such young age (18).

## **Introduction**

It all started last November, when soccer season was done and I didn't make tryouts to our high school basketball team. My host dad Bob came up with a perfect idea that I can run over the whole winter.

There is one thing which you need to know about Bob. He is super passionate about running. Without him, I would not run marathon today. **He showed me that running can be a beautiful thing if you know, what you are actually running for.**

On the left picture you can see me with him after my first 5K race. On the other picture, you can see me finishing 4th half-marathon in my life which I ran year after the marathon.

Here is why I started running. I wanted to break the school record in one mile, so people at my high school would never forget about that kid from Czech republic. Believe it or not, this kept motivating me over the whole winter when I ran over 900 km. **Was I making any change?**

Well, I was. However at that point, it was not visible. When track season came, I was not doing as good as I assumed I am going to. It was really frustrating, however I was lucky enough to have a coach Snyder who again showed me **why I am running.**

He told me: “Lu, who are you running for? Run for yourself, not for me or your host dad.” This made me realise that he is right and I started to see that I am actually changing my life.

How was I changing it? I had to change the lifestyle which I used to have. I realised that if I want to run well, I have to sleep and eat well. So I started to apply this day by day and then finally **last race in the track season came**. I was not supposed to beat my teammates in this race since it was 800m = fast race.

However, something strange happened to me and I felt like I was flying that race and I placed 3rd before all my teammates who kept beating me all the season. It was a huge reward for all my hard work. However, I was more happy about different thing. I MADE A CHANGE. I motivated one of my teammates to start running over the winter, because he was scared that I am going to beat him in the season.

## **Point of the article**
I made couple changes but they were not really visible. I needed something **BIG.** I needed something what would make people say: “How did you do that? That is impossible.” **MARATHON**.

**BREAKING MOMENT**. When I told this to coach Snyder and my host dad BOB, both of them loved that idea. They told me that I can do it. Again, without them I would not run marathon.

We made a plan right away with my host dad. Once I got back from America, I started practicing. I ran 5 days a week. Building my mileage up. Waking up in early morning to run. **I RAN FOR THE CHANGE.**

AGAIN, I had the reason to run. I just wanted my friends to realise that everything is possible if you work for it. There were so many people who didn't believe me when I told them that I want to run marathon.

> "I was too young, unexperienced. It was impossible, too dangerous, crazy, out of comfort zone. It hurts. It is a lot of work. Unthinkable. Painful. Too hard.""

No. These were all just excuses which I decided not to accept. And it paid since I managed to finish marathon in 3 hours and 10 minutes being among 20 runners out of 300. However, these numbers are not important at all. Important is the message which I shared through this - Set a clear goal, plan and then just move forward until you reach the goal. Then set yourself even more challenging goal.
