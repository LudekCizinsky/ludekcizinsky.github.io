excerpt: At the age of 16, I found out about the project from Marek Liška, who set himself a goal to come up with student friendly Math textbooks. He came to one of our Math classes and offered us to join his team. I did not hesitate and joined him.

## **Writer of Math textbook at ProSpolužáky.cz**

### **About the project**
In order to understand what is the whole project about, feel free to watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leQb2Src17U">two minute video</a>, which explains everything about the project and its aims.

### **Why I decided to join**

When Marek Liška came to our class and introduce us to an idea to write Math textbooks for students in order help high school students better understand Math and possibly make their life easier, most of my classmates thought it was nothing for them. I thought it was a great idea because I often had to help my classmates with Math, so this was an opportunity to help not only to my classmates but to thousands of other students from our country.

### **My responsibilities**

In the beginning, the whole team of 20 student writers was divided into 4 sub-teams of 5 based on the high school each member attended for an easier communication. Each week, we were assigned with particular chapter in the textbook which we had to write theory and examples for. Our teamwork was then sent to our team leader who did a revision of our work.

**Here are the key responsibilities:**
* Writing **student friendly theory** about several 10th grade Math topics
* Coming up with **Math problems** based on the theory and then write how to solve given problems
* Go through already solved Math problems and make sure the explanation is clear and the results are correct
* Making sure I am **meeting given deadlines** and I do my best to hand in top quality work without any mistakes

### **Key takeaways**
I spent working on this project over 7 months, but then I went on my exchange student year to the US, therefore I could not continue working for ProSpolužáky.cz. I am  very grateful to Marek Liška, founder of ProSpolužáky.cz, for the opportunity to join the team and work on such exciting project as well as gain **valuable work experience** which gave me the following:
* Development of my Math skills through explaining Math to others
* Learning how to use Math tools like **Geogebra** or **LaTex**
* Sense of what it takes to deliver a great product to the market
* Sense of **responsibility** for my work and its **outcome**
* The importance of communication in team and choosing right team members
