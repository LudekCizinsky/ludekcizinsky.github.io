## **Marketing and  business development at ProSpolužáky.cz**

### **Why I decided to join**

I worked for ProSpolužáky.cz before I went to an exchange year and I liked the team and the overall work a lot. You can read about my previous experience <a href="https://ludekcizinsky.github.io/project/work2">here.</a> That led me to meet up with the founder, Marek Liška, again and start working on marketing and business development.

### **My responsibilities**
In the beginning, there was no marketing neither PR strategy at all. My goal was clear: Create a marketing and PR strategy for the Czech market as well as Slovakian market. Once it will be approved by investor, turn it into reality.

**Here is how it went:**
* Research
* Strategy
* Execution
* Outcome

#### **Research**
We decided to conduct a market research in cooperation with an external company. Our main task was to come up with relevant questions which would give us answers for variables in our marketing strategy.

Due to the cost of the whole market research, we made sure to include questions that would give us interesting answers for future articles in media. Thanks to the research we gained some valuable insights that helped us with creating the strategy. However, in order to get a whole picture we had to analyse data from website (Google analytics), marketing tools (BM, Adwords, Sklik) and also look at the feedback given by our customers.

---

#### **Strategy**
We started out with setting strategy for Czech market. Firstly, we chose channels through which we were going to communicate. Secondly, we put it in timeline and added content strategy. Thirdly, we allocated money to each channel for given time of the year.

Setting strategy for Slovakian market was a little bit different since we did not have many data and had to rely solely on what we were able to find on the Internet and other business owners' experience.

I would conclude that the whole process of setting strategy strongly relies on how well you do your research and therefore what data you have collected. It is important to say that marketing and PR strategy should not be  a matter of just a marketing team, rather it should include opinions from other team members from product development team through sales team. Therefore I rolled up my sleeves and made sure I spent time with all members from the company, so I know what the real problems are and how I can help them solve it.

#### **Execution**
After the presentation before investor and his approval, we could start making things happen. At this point, we had to hire the right people and make sure we meet given goals. We have met and negotiated with several freelancers and agencies. There was twice as much work since we had to do it for both Czech and Slovakian market. In this phase, it is always important to set clear expectations and conditions of cooperation otherwise the cooperation won't most likely last long and this costs money, energy and precious time.

Note that often the most expensive option is not always the best. Since we were startup with limited budget, we could not afford to hire agency whose clients are mostly big corporates. In other words, this agency can not go down with its standards and so do you with your budget. We ended up hiring freelancers who do not have to pay expensive offices and pay often more attention to your business since you are just one of the few they chose to work for.

When everything started running according to the plan, I realised that due to the amount of people working for us externally, it was crucial to build up a workflow which I would be able to use each month to run all processes ,including administration, as smoothly as possible. It is also important that quality of work delivered by external companies is according to the expectations set in the beginning.

#### **Outcome**
In this section, I would like to evaluate our work over the period of approximately two years.
* **Czech marketing**
  * One of my main responsibilities was to increase sales at our e-shop. Despite increased traffic on our website, we did not manage to get more conversions (sold textbooks). However, what was more important for us was a realisation that we need to focus more on direct selling to schools. Another important factor which I did not consider in the beginning, was the field of our business - education. At least in our country, it is known to be strongly conventional. Also from view of student, it makes more sense to follow literature recommended by the teacher. Below you can check out new e-shop of the firm.

* **Czech PR**
  * We focused on media, events and competitions. First of all, we started doing PR ourselves with a help from external mentor. This rapidly decreased cost of PR, yet the results were even better. In terms of media coverage, we managed to be in <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/10805121298-gejzir/217562235000029/obsah/597616-ucebnice-matematiky">national TV</a>, <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/hradec-kralove/zpravy/matika-pro-spoluzaky-hradec-student-marek-liska-ucebnice-matematika.A180914_426934_hradec-zpravy_pos">regional newspaper</a> or Forbes. I also decided to organise <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/285794192059091/?active_tab=about">couple talks</a> in-house where we shared our startup's story as well as experience from business with public. I also got the founder of ProSpolužáky.cz to several events where he shared his experience about difficulties in the beginning and what we are actually working on right now. I am also very proud we managed to win several competitions including <a href="https://www.forbes.cz/seznamte-se-forbes-oceni-mlade-lidry-projektu-ktere-maji-ambice-zmenit-svet/">Top 5 of Czech SDGs awards for young leaders</a>, <a href="http://starty.cz/clanky/startupy/dalsi-inspirativni-mashup-vecer-je-za-nami/">MashUp Prague</a> or <a href="https://startupper.total.com/ro/challenges/startupper-total/pages/gagnants?lang=en">Startupper of the year</a> (European round).

* **Slovakian marketing**
  * We managed to put together whole eshop including all copywriting, images and graphics. We also ran several PPC campaigns to get people on our website and see our products.
* **Slovakian PR**
  * We hired external freelancer who helped us organise initial event for main Slovakian media including Deník N or Pravda. I would say our first into Slovakian in terms of PR was very successful since there were articles and TV news about our books in all major media houses in Slovakia.
* **HR**
  * As a startup you really need people who are dedicated to your product and do not work for you because of good money. I learnt that having great CV is not necessary a mark of good candidate. I was advised by my mentor to try a method, where I give candidates task which involves skills needed for the given position. This advice proved to be as a great one since it helped me recognise the right candidates and future team members to our firm.
* **Video production**
  * There were couple projects where I needed to direct production of videos about our company and product. (see below) It was a valuable experience since I had to have detailed plan of what we are going to shoot, when and with whom. I also had to choose right music and write text.
  * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHlyJVtHRrE&t=2s">Video about the story of ProSpoluzaky.cz</a>
  * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk4q90d3x-s">Video explaining where and how are books are being printed</a>
* **Graphics**
  * Since we were startup, it was often needed from me to put together graphics for our eshop or just online campaigns. I am grateful for this experience since it helped me to understand the whole process behind making any graphics from posters to product photos.

#### **Conclusion**
The two years in ProSpolužáky.cz were pretty intense since I was required to work almost full-time, take a lot of responsibility, manage people and at the same time I was studying at high school and tried to have best grades possible. On the other side, I gained a lot of diverse experience in a short period of time as well as I could be part of a great team working on enhancing Czech and Slovakian education. Therefore I am very grateful for this life changing experience which showed me how hard is to actually build successful business and what one has to sacrify.
