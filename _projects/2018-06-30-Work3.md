## **Codename: Project USA**

### **Why I decided to create this project**
I was an exchange student in Michigan, academic year 2016 - 2017. This year long experience definitely change my life in many ways and most importantly, it gave me new friends to whom I promised I will come back to see their graduation ceremony. I realised that I could connect two things together - see my friends as well as make a small documentary about what it is like to live and study in the USA which would be a great addition to the website which I already created with my friend called <a href="https://www.feeltheusa.com">feeltheusa.</a>

### **How did I manage it?**
First of all, I found a partner - Czech agency CCI. We made a deal that I will come to US to shoot a short documentary about life in the US for them and they will in exchange pay for my and my colleague Lukas travel expenses. Lukas has never been to the US before, however he has been travelling for a while around Europe and Asia and had experience with shooting videos. We therefore put together our plan of what we want to shoot, what we want to see and put it on timeline. Then booked plane tickets, manage accommodation and waited for the day of our flight which was in May 2018.

### **How did it go?**
I do not want to go into much details and I believe one video speaks for thousands words. Therefore you can see a trailer video <a href="https://youtu.be/Bv0Jp8lI-MU">here.</a>

### **What did I learn from it?**
This experience really gave me further self-confidence in terms of being able to envision a goal and then to make concrete steps in order to make it. Although, there seemed to be many complications in the beginning from not having enough money to missing a school for a two weeks, I managed to handle all of them. This showed me that we often fear things which seemed to be too risky to do and it is more comfortable for us to rather do nothing. However, this way, one can miss out on many great things just because of fear.
