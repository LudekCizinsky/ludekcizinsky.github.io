## **Internship in Brusel**

### **Why I decided to take this Internship**
By time I am writing this text, I am 20 years old and I am hungry for any opportunity to experience interesting positions. This was definitely one of them. I got to see day to day business of European parliament. Additionally, it was great to have couple talks with Jiří Pospíšil about his view on EU and its future.

### **What was my path to this opportunity?**
You might be surprised, but I have never considered an Internship in EP until the day I was offered it. That does not necessary mean I was not going towards it. The whole story started when of our active high school teachers asked Mr. Pospíšil to come over and have a presentation about EU. He, indeed, asked us several questions and tried to have a discussion with us. However, I was one of the few if not the only one who tried to respond to him. Some people call it being a "geek", I call it using full potential of everyday opportunities. After his presentation, he asked our teacher to whom he could offer the Internship. Well, since I had this approach of being active also in the teacher's class and on top of that being active member of school parliament, the first name which came to my teacher's name was mine. Note that this is not about your IQ, background or anything else. It is about attitude which you show. Show active attitude and sooner or later, you will get where you want.

### **How did it go?**
It went pretty well since I could use part of my time in EP to help Mr. Pospíšil and his team and the other part to take part in different forums and discussions. The EP itself is an amazing place to be at because you are in an international environment where you can meet so many different people with so many different habits and views on the world. So overall, I would say it was an enriching experience in terms of knowing new people, getting to know day to day business of EP member and also seeing the place from inside.

### **What did I learn from it?**
The key takeaway for me was to see how are policies being made. What people in EP consider, how they think of it, what questions they ask and how they are searching for answers. I am strategic man who likes to know every aspect of a problem and this "law" perspective was actually missing in my skillset and therefore I am glad that I managed to start with good fundamental experience on top which I can carry on in learning.
