excerpt: I decided to do something useful for my maturita project, which was part of my final maturita examination from Information technology. I created a complete campaign for my high school focused on future students explaining them reasons why to join Gymnázium J. K. Tyla v Hradci Králové.

## **Maturita project: Marketing campaign for my high school**

### **About the project**
When deciding what topic to choose for my final maturita work, I decided to go for what I have been doing past two years - complete reusable marketing campaign. Therefore the whole project was built in way that it can serve not only as one year marketing campaign but rather as a tool for the high school to explain to potential students what is the school about and what are the core values for many years on.

## **Good plan is the key**
I will go very shortly about the whole process since it was quite time demanding and there would be a lot to cover. The core thing I did was a very well made strategic plan in which I first conducted analyses of what I really want to solve and then specifically writing down steps what is needed to do. I put it on a mindmap which you can see below.

As you can see, the main idea was to collect people via different channels and get them to a landing page where they would get all needed info and then could decide whether they want to put GJKT on their list or not. So the only thing I needed to figure out was how to create the content.

## **The creative part**
The toughest thing here was to come up with a main motto which would represent the whole school and its core values. I decided to go for "Gymnazium J. K. Tyla, place where you will be able to figure out who you are and what you want to pursuit in life." Then I tried to build the whole content around this core idea. See <a href="http://www.chcinatyla.cz/">here</a>, how it all ended up. (Note: The school already added some new content so what you see is a version 1.2)

## **Key takeaways**
First of all, it was very important for me that I already had contacts on people who were able to help me with the speaking part (Roman Straka, Rádio Černá hora) and then also with the shooting video part (TMRW production). Secondly, I think it was pretty important for me to know right from the beginning what is my goal and what is the key message I want to share.

## **Complete documentation**
I also had to write a documentation of my work which actually ended up being almost 80 pages long. You can read it <a href="https://github.com/LudekCizinsky/Marketing-campaign-GJKT/blob/master/Maturitni%CC%81%20pra%CC%81ce%20-%20PDF%20soubor.pdf">here.</a>

## **Additional materials**
I also managed to put together materials for IG (Story + main page), FB (ad banners) and poster. So it would be an overall complete campaign. See some examples below. Full materials can be found <a href="https://github.com/LudekCizinsky/Marketing-campaign-GJKT/upload">here.</a>
